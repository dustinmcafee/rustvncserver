The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.0-beta.3] - 2025-10-23

### Changed

- Updated `rfb-encodings` dependency from `0.1` to `0.1.3`
  - Fixes critical build failure when using `turbojpeg` feature without `debug-logging`
  - Resolves "use of unresolved module or unlinked crate log" compilation errors
  - All turbojpeg builds now work correctly

## [2.0.0-beta.2] - 2025-10-23

### Fixed

- Code formatting: Removed extra blank line in `protocol.rs`

## [2.0.0-beta.1] - 2025-10-23

### Changed

- **Major architectural refactoring:** Extracted all encoding implementations to separate `rfb-encodings` crate
  - All encoding modules (Raw, RRE, CoRRE, Hextile, Zlib, Tight, TightPng, ZlibHex, ZRLE, ZYWRLE) moved to `rfb-encodings`
  - Pixel format translation moved to `rfb-encodings`
  - `PixelFormat` struct now re-exported from `rfb-encodings`
  - Benefits:
    - Encoding implementations now reusable across VNC servers, clients, proxies, and recorders
    - Cleaner separation of concerns: protocol vs encoding
    - Independent versioning and publishing of encodings
    - Better visibility and discoverability on crates.io
  - **Fully backwards compatible:** All public APIs preserved through re-exports
  - Existing code using `rustvncserver::encoding::*` or `rustvncserver::PixelFormat` continues to work

### Added

- New dependency: `rfb-encodings` crate (0.1.2) for all encoding implementations
- Re-exported all encoding types from `rfb-encodings` for full backwards compatibility
- `pub use rfb_encodings as encoding;` allows seamless access to all encodings

### Fixed

- All fixes from rfb-encodings 0.1.1 and 0.1.2 inherited:
  - macOS CI Build: Fixed turbojpeg linking errors
  - Compiler warnings for conditional compilation suppressed

## [1.1.5] - 2025-10-23

### Fixed
- **Critical RRE encoding bug:** Fixed data loss causing severe visual corruption and flickering
  - Root cause: Encoder had an "efficiency check" that would return 0 subrectangles when RRE encoding was larger than raw
  - This told VNC clients to paint the entire rectangle with only the background color, discarding all other pixel data
  - For video content or complex images with many colors, this resulted in constant flickering as frames alternated between partial data (background color only) and complete data
  - **Solution:** Always encode all pixels as subrectangles, even if RRE is inefficient
  - Ensures correct visual output at all times; protocol layer can choose different encoding if efficiency is a concern
  - Eliminates flickering and visual artifacts when using RRE encoding

## [1.1.3] - 2025-01-22

### Fixed
- **Critical TIGHT encoding bug:** Fixed persistent zlib stream implementation causing "Incomplete zlib block" errors
  - Root cause: `compress_data()` was creating fresh `ZlibEncoder` instances with `finish()` instead of using persistent streams
  - The control bytes indicated persistent stream IDs (0, 1, 2), but fresh streams created self-contained zlib blocks
  - This caused client decompressors to fail with "Incomplete zlib block" when expecting continuation data
  - **Solution:** Removed `stream.reset()` call that was destroying dictionary state
  - Now properly maintains dictionary state across compressions using `FlushCompress::Sync` (Z_SYNC_FLUSH)
  - Threaded persistent `TightStreamCompressor` through all encoding functions
  - Stream IDs correctly implemented per RFC 6143: 0=full-color, 1=mono, 2=indexed
  - Eliminates decompression errors and connection instability with noVNC and other clients

## [1.1.2] - 2025-01-21

### Fixed
- **Critical encoding bug:** Fixed server incorrectly selecting COPYRECT as preferred encoding
  - Server was blindly using the first encoding from client's list, which could be COPYRECT
  - COPYRECT is only for copy rectangle operations, not general framebuffer encoding
  - Now properly skips COPYRECT and selects the first supported encoding (TIGHT, ZRLE, etc.)
  - Eliminates "Encoding 1 not available, falling back to RAW" error and poor performance

## [1.1.1] - 2025-01-21

### Added
- **Security feature:** `debug-logging` feature flag to control verbose logging
  - Hides sensitive information (client IPs, connection details, protocol versions) by default
  - Enable with `features = ["debug-logging"]` for troubleshooting
  - Operational logs (server startup, client connect/disconnect) remain visible

### Fixed
- Eliminated all unused variable and assignment warnings when `debug-logging` is disabled
- Fixed clippy `uninlined_format_args` warning in tight.rs
- Code formatting consistency with `cargo fmt`

### Changed
- Updated minimum Rust version requirement from 1.76 to 1.90 in CONTRIBUTING.md
